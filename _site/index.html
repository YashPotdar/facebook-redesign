<h1 id="background">Background</h1>

<h2 id="our-mission">Our Mission</h2>
<p>Our team aims to redesign Facebook to be centered around communication and community-building and have better accessibility for senior citizens. We have identified a problem that individuals in the 65+ community need a more streamlined way to find communities in their local sphere in order to foster new relationships and engage with others in social settings.</p>

<h2 id="our-motivation-and-my-personal-motivation">Our Motivation (and my Personal Motivation)</h2>
<p>Individuals in the 65+ community face mental health issues at alarmingly high rates. Mental health among senior citizens is a big issue, as around 20% of individuals aged 55 or older have mental health problems as estimated by the  <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/aging/pdf/mental_health.pdf" target="_blank">CDC</a>. In fact, senior males have the highest rate of suicide among any other age group, and this may be due to depression or anxiety relating to aging and lack of motivation and fulfillment. Senior citizens are also more likely than other age groups to report that they “rarely” or “never” received the social and emotional support they needed.</p>

<p>In my case, I definitely witnessed my grandparents in India could not be as mobile as they used to, and would be lonely and bored throughout the days. Being in a different country than their grandchildren was definitely difficult for their mental health.</p>

<h2 id="target-audience">Target Audience</h2>
<p>Our case study was centered around the 65+ community. We plan to add our redesign as an opt-in interface that is catered towards our target audience and would not impede other users if they prefer the current UI.</p>

<h2 id="our-objectives">Our Objectives</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Ensure that seniors are able to join communities that align with their interests.</li>
  <li>Ensure that seniors have a streamlined experience when contacting their closest friends and loved ones.</li>
  <li>Allow seniors to easily find events that align with their hobbies.</li>
  <li>Reduce the learning curve of Facebook and highlight essential features desired by seniors.</li>
  <li>Reduce sentiments of alienation and increase fulfillment within the 65+ community.</li>
</ul>
